## Modern Data Engineering GCP Project

### Introduction

The Uber Data Analytics project focuses on leveraging various tools and technologies to perform data analytics on Uber data. The project utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services such as Storage, Compute Instance, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. Additionally, it incorporates the Modern Data Pipeline Tool from Mage Data to streamline the data engineering process.

### Architecture

The architecture of the project involves several components:

Programming Language: Python is used for data processing and analysis.
Google Cloud Platform: GCP provides the infrastructure and services for the project.
Google Storage: Used for storing the Uber data.
Compute Instance: Provides the compute resources for running the data analytics tasks.
BigQuery: Enables querying and analyzing the Uber data using SQL.
Looker Studio: A data visualization and exploration platform for generating insights from the data.
Modern Data Pipeline Tool: The project utilizes Mage Data, an open-source tool, for efficient and streamlined data pipeline operations.
